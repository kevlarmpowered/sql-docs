# LAST_VALUE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

  Returns the last value in an ordered set of values.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  

```syntaxsql 
LAST_VALUE ( [ scalar_expression ] )  [ IGNORE NULLS | RESPECT NULLS ]
    OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause rows_range_clause )   
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *scalar_expression*  
 Is the value to be returned. *scalar_expression* can be a column, subquery, or other expression that results in a single value. Other analytic functions are not permitted.  
  
 [ IGNORE NULLS | RESPECT NULLS ]     
 **Applies to**: Azure SQL Edge

 IGNORE NULLS - Ignore null values in the dataset when computing the last value over a partition.     
 RESPECT NULLS - Respect null values in the dataset when computing last value over a partition.     
 
  For more information, see [Imputing missing values](/azure/azure-sql-edge/imputing-missing-values/).
  
 OVER **(** [ *partition_by_clause* ] *order_by_clause* [ *rows_range_clause* ] **)**  
 *partition_by_clause* divides the result set produced by the FROM clause into partitions to which the function is applied. If not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group.  
  
 *order_by_clause* determines the order of the data before the function is applied. The *order_by_clause* is required. *rows_range_clause* further limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Return Types  
 Is the same type as *scalar_expression*.  
  
## General Remarks  
 LAST_VALUE is nondeterministic. For more information, see [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using LAST_VALUE over partitions  
 The following example returns the hire date of the last employee in each department for the given salary (Rate). The PARTITION BY clause partitions the employees by department and the LAST_VALUE function is applied to each partition independently. The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause determines the logical order in which the LAST_VALUE function is applied to the rows in each partition.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT Department, LastName, Rate, HireDate,   
    LAST_VALUE(HireDate) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Rate) AS LastValue  
FROM HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
INNER JOIN HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph    
    ON eph.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e  
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
WHERE Department IN (N'Information Services',N'Document Control');   
```

### B. Using FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE in a computed expression  
 The following example uses the FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE functions in computed expressions to show the difference between the sales quota value for the current quarter and the first and last quarter of the year respectively for a given number of employees. The FIRST_VALUE function returns the sales quota value for the first quarter of the year, and subtracts it from the sales quota value for the current quarter. It is returned in the derived column entitled DifferenceFromFirstQuarter. For the first quarter of a year, the value of the DifferenceFromFirstQuarter column is 0. The LAST_VALUE function returns the sales quota value for the last quarter of the year, and subtracts it from the sales quota value for the current quarter. It is returned in the derived column entitled DifferenceFromLastQuarter. For the last quarter of a year, the value of the DifferenceFromLastQuarter column is 0.  
  
 The clause "RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING" is required in this example for the non-zero values to be returned in the DifferenceFromLastQuarter column, as shown below. The default range is "RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW". In this example, using that default range (or not including a range, resulting in the default being used) would result in zeroes being returned in the DifferenceFromLastQuarter column. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
SELECT BusinessEntityID, DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate)AS Quarter, YEAR(QuotaDate) AS SalesYear,   
    SalesQuota AS QuotaThisQuarter,   
    SalesQuota - FIRST_VALUE(SalesQuota)   
        OVER (PARTITION BY BusinessEntityID, YEAR(QuotaDate)   
              ORDER BY DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate) ) AS DifferenceFromFirstQuarter,   
    SalesQuota - LAST_VALUE(SalesQuota)   
        OVER (PARTITION BY BusinessEntityID, YEAR(QuotaDate)   
              ORDER BY DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate)   
              RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING ) AS DifferenceFromLastQuarter   
FROM Sales.SalesPersonQuotaHistory   
WHERE YEAR(QuotaDate) > 2005   
AND BusinessEntityID BETWEEN 274 AND 275   
ORDER BY BusinessEntityID, SalesYear, Quarter;  
```
